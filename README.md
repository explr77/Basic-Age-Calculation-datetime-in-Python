# Basic-Age-Calculation-datetime-in-Python
A basic age calculator using datetime in Python
This program was written in iPad app Python3IDE

The purpose of this program was to use datetime, as a function, and change the format of the input to month, day, year.
If you know a better way to complete the task, while keeping the month, day, year format, please let me know.

Thank you,
